So there you go.  If you like it, then I guess you should know that I drew it, and you can see more by clicking <a href=drawing.html>here</a>.<P>Or maybe you think that this drawing really is kind of boring and shouldn't be here at all, so in that case you probably shouldn't click up there.  In that case you might want to look at something else...Like maybe <a href=skate.html>this</a>, which is a page about roller skating, which I decided to make because roller skating is the only sport which I have as of yet found tollerable. <P>Or, right about now, maybe  you  are thinking that this page is really pretty dumb considering that this is supposed to be about some computer challenge technical wizard type person.  If you are thinking something like that, then click <a href="list.html">here</a> to see a list of the pages that I have written. And if by now you haven't found something to look at here, then you are obviously nothing like me.  If you are like that, click <a href="surprise.html">here</a>.<P><hr>But whatever you decide to do, write me at rholwick@hotmail.com and tell me what you think...thanks for looking here...enjoy... </center></td><td><center><img src="hatter.gif"></center></td></tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>
