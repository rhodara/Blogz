My name is Roberta Hodara.  I am the teacher and coordinator of the 1998 SuperComputer Challenge team.  It's been a real privilege and challenge working with these talented students.     I teach Computer Science at Seabury Hall School in Makawao, Maui, Hawaii.  In addition to teaching and running the school computer lab, I have other interests, hobbies and responsibilities.  I have 3 children and my husband, Mr. Alan Hodara is an English teacher at Seabury.  I have two hobbies: painting and ceramics.  </FONT></body></html>
