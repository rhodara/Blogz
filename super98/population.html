This program, written with Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0, attempts to create a fairly simple, dynamic model of a gene pool in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Individuals mate, pass on their genetic makeup, grow old, and die.  Throughout the growth process, they are continually exposed to pressures created by the user.  In addition to overpopulation, incubation periods, and the 'Edge Effect,' individuals with a double recessive genetic makeup may find death or sterility to delete their inheritance from the gene pool.<p>	The model may be used to simulate such conceptual genetic events as a recessive gene bank or a genetic bottleneck -- the genetic hindrance which currently affects the Nene.  The dispersal of a population into harsh territory may also be modeled by using the 'Edge Effect.'  Throughout all of the events of the population, a visual representation of the cells delivers a map of the population, and a list of to the right keeps tabs on all of the populations vital statistics.<P></hr><P></BODY></HTML>
